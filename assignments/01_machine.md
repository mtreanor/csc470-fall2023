# Assignmemnt 1: Rube Goldberg Machine
Create a simple “Rube Goldberg Machine” out of simple 3d shapes with custom colors/materials, at least two 3d models from (http://poly.pizza)[http://poly.pizza], and the RigidBody component. While the primary purpose of this small exercise is for you to practice using the Unity user interface, you can still make some fun/hilarious stuff, so have fun! Also, while future exercises will be done with a partner, do this one individually.

## Topics we covered that you should demonstrate ability with
- The transform tools: translate, rotate, and scale. Select each by pressing the W, E, and R keys respectively.
- Controlling the editor camera: Rotate, Pan, and Zoom. https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html
- Creating primitive 3d shapes
- Creating and applying materials to the shapes
- Applying the RigidBody physics component to game objects
- Finding and importing 3d models from http://poly.pizza. When getting models from here, remember three things: 1. You need to include the entire unzipped folder you download in to the Assets folder of your Unity project, 2. Some of these models are just broken. To avoid difficulties you might want to stick to ones made by google or Kenney, and 3. Remember that you will need to add collider components to your models in Unity (use Box, Sphere, or Capsule).
- How to make the in game camera show a solid color background rather than the default skybox.
