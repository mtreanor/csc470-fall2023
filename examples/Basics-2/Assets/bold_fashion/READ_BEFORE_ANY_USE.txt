-----------------------

Bold Fashion is a heavy slab-serif font of the disco era. 
Its funk-style design, coupled with soft, rounded serifs, embodies the soul of retro, bringing forth memories of neon lights, bell-bottoms, and roller discos. Each letter is profoundly heavy, yet they prance with a bouncy, comfy rhythm, akin to catchy 70s beats. 
The swashes adorning the uppercase letters add flair, reminiscent of iconic burger joint signs and groovy vinyl covers. Despite its fun, funky nature, there's a clear professionalism to the font, allowing it to strut its stuff in both playful and serious settings.

The Bold Fashion family consists of 16 styles, such as Swash, Clean, Light, Black, Regular and Italic. 

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and has a guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures, and more features; all to give you full control and customizability. It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from Northern Europe to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers.

Crafted with precision by Mans Greback, Bold Fashion is more than just type â€“ it's a typographic king of an era. Through the typeface, Greback pays homage to the past, providing creatives with a tool that reimagines the spirit of the 70s for contemporary designs.
